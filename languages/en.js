/**
 * English Translation File for Disutils Team Website
 *
 * This file contains all the English translations for the Disutils Team website.
 * It includes text for navigation, footer, pages, and other UI elements.
 *
 * Language Code: en
 * Author: RejectModders
 * Discord: rejectmodders
 * Last Updated: 4/11/2025
 *
 * Usage:
 * - This file is automatically loaded by the language middleware.
 * - Ensure all keys match the structure defined in the base language file (e.g., `en.js`).
 * - Do not remove or rename keys, as this may break functionality.
 *
 * Guidelines:
 * - Placeholders (e.g., {seconds}, {minutes}) must remain intact.
 * - Team names, user names, and specific terms (e.g., "RejectModders", "Disutils Team") must not be translated.
 * - Use consistent formatting and indentation for readability.
 *
 * Note: If adding new keys, ensure they are added to all other language files for consistency.
